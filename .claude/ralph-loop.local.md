Implement pizza cart functionality in the frontend using TDD.

Process:
1. Write failing test for next requirement
2. Implement minimal code to pass
3. Run tests
4. If failing, fix and retry
5. Refactor if needed
6. Repeat for all requirements

Requirements:
- Create cart functionality in the frontend application to add, remove and update the pizza items added to the order
- The front end should enable the user to select multiple pizza types and quantity and add that to the order
- Follow the data model defined in the store service for the Order and OrderItems 

Output <promise>DONE</promise> when all tests green.
